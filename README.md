# AI-Medical-Chatbot-NLP-LLMs
Add AI Medical Chatbot using NLP and LLMs for healthcare query assistance
This commit introduces the AI Medical Chatbot project, designed to assist users with healthcare-related queries using NLP and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Key Features:
- Integrated transformer-based NLP models for understanding medical questions
- Implemented intent classification and entity recognition for accurate responses
- Enabled context-aware conversation flow for symptom-based guidance
- Designed Streamlit web interface for real-time chat interaction
- Included dataset preprocessing and fine-tuning scripts for domain adaptation

Highlights:
• Tools & Tech: Python, Transformers (Hugging Face), spaCy, Streamlit, OpenAI API  
• Capabilities: Symptom analysis, basic medical advice, and condition probability estimation  
• Ethical Compliance: Provides only informational support — not a substitute for professional diagnosis  
• Next Step: Add multilingual support and integrate with a clinical knowledge base (e.g., PubMed or MedQuAD)

Project Impact:
Empowers users to get quick, AI-driven insights into health symptoms while maintaining responsible AI use through disclaimer-based design and restricted output filters.
